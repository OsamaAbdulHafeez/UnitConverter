    "content": "Unit conversions are essential in daily life, from cooking to engineering. This guide breaks down the process into simple steps so you can convert any unit with confidence. Start by identifying your source and target units, then determine the conversion factor. For example, converting meters to centimeters uses the factor 100. Multiply the original value by the conversion factor, and always double-check your units to ensure accuracy. For more complex categories like temperature, use the correct formulas (e.g., C to F or K).",
