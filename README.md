🚀 Project Setup Guide (Next.js)
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1️⃣ Install Node.js (LTS version)
Download the LTS version of Node.js from the official site:
🔗 https://nodejs.org

After installation, verify Node.js is installed by running:

node -v

You should see a version number (e.g., v18.x.x).

2️⃣ Extract the Project
Unzip the project files to your preferred folder.

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

This will create the node_modules folder.
